[00:07.28] I stared up at the sun
[00:14.50] Thought of all of the people, places and things I've loved
[00:21.79] I stared up just to see
[00:22.36] With all of the faces, you were the one next to me
[00:47.36] 
[00:22.55] You can feel the light start to tremble
[00:26.10] Washing what you know out to sea, yeah
[00:30.09] You can see your life out of the window tonight
[00:53.59] 
[00:38.54] If I lose myself tonight
[00:43.01] It'll be by your side
[00:46.56] I lose myself tonight
[00:51.40] Whoa, yeah, yeah
[00:54.28] If I lose myself tonight
[00:58.30] It'll be you and I
[01:01.55] Lose myself tonight

[01:45.94] You can see your life out of the window tonight
[02:09.44] 
[01:54.45] If I lose myself tonight
